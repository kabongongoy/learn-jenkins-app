# Install Jenkins using Docker Compose

This repository contains a Docker Compose configuration for a quick installation of Jenkins. This setup is not intended for production systems.

Credits: This approach is mostly based on the [offical instructions](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/) but takes advantage of Docker Compose (by using a `docker-compose.yml` file) to reduce the number of steps needed to get Jenkins up and running.

# Docker Installation

## Step 1

Install Docker locally (probably using Docker Desktop is the easiest approach).

## Step 2

Clone this repository or download it's contents. 

## Step 2

Open a terminal window in the same directory where the `Dockerfile` from this repository is located. Build the Jenkins Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-jenkins .
```

## Step 3

Start Jenkins:

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Step 4

Open Jenkins by going to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and finish the installation process.

## Step 5

If you wish to stop Jenkins and get back to it later, run:

```
docker compose down
```

If you wish to start Jenkins again later, just run the same comand from Step 3.


# Removing Jenkins

Once you are done playing with Jenkins maybe it is time to clean things up.

Run the following comand to terminate Jenkins and to remove all volumes and images used:

```
docker compose down --volumes --rmi all 
```

# Learn Jenkins App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
